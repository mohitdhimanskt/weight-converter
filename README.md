Project 2: Weight Converter

In the following tutorial you'll learn how to make a Weight Converter application. You'll make use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. At first you'll be building the basic layout of the frontend (the HTML & CSS). After you'll start writing the JavaScript logic that will convert pounds into grams.

In order to speed up development you'll be using a CSS framework: Bootstrap 4. While coding along, have a look through the documentation in order to get familiar with the different class names to see what they do.
